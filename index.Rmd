# 1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing interest in active transportation modes, such as walking and cycling, due to their potential benefits in improving public health, enhancing quality of life, and promoting urban redevelopment. The design of a "walkable" city has emerged as a key strategy for reducing the negative health effects associated with automobile dependency. Furthermore, fostering vibrant street life has become a critical approach to urban redevelopment in many countries, including the United States. However, while past studies have extensively explored the impact of the built environment on street dynamism, a significant number of them have focused on motorized transportation modes, while neglecting the study of pedestrian activity. <br/><br/>It is crucial to understand the underlying relationship between spatial patterns of pedestrian activity, aggregation or dispersion, and environmental features in order to promote pedestrian safety. Advances in remote scanning technology, which are utilized in intelligent transportation systems and public safety evacuation research, enable the monitoring of pedestrian activity and movement, facilitating a better understanding of complex collective behaviors in social systems. Drawing on prior research, this study applies K-Mean and random forest algorithms in machine learning to examine the spatial patterns of pedestrian numbers, built environment contributors, and spoilers on eight high-traffic streets in Buffalo, New York. Independent variables, including pedestrian generators, demographic characteristics, crime rates, and land-use combinations, are included in the analysis to investigate the influence of neighborhood environmental characteristics on pedestrian willingness to walk.

# 2. Literature Review

There is a wealth of literature on increasing street liveliness, dating back to Jacobs' emphasis on variety at both the district and street levels. Jacobs strongly advocates for the intelligent use of street life to revitalize older neighborhoods, resulting in dense, mixed-use clusters, as evidenced by her examination of several areas in New York City. Kevin Lynch examines urban perception to increase street vitality from the perspective of locals. Jan Gehl uses space qualities to either welcome or repel, and White highlights the importance of street design and building layout in fostering thriving street life. Rowley suggests that beautiful street designs and mixed-use structures promote street vitality and boost the regional economy. The relationship between urban planning, pedestrian activity, and consumer behavior has also been studied. To increase walkability, American cities have implemented various measures such as constructing housing in downtown areas, enhancing public transportation, and establishing supportive community structures. Earlier research has established a theoretical framework for investigating the possibility of modifying built environments to increase street dynamism. Although previous studies have touched on the clustering of pedestrian activity and its relationship with the built environment to some extent, it was not until the early 2000s that quantitative investigations of the link between community environment and pedestrian activity, as well as related modeling tools, were developed due to the lack of adequate spatial methodologies.

## 2.1. Built Environment and Pedestrians

The importance of destination accessibility in attracting pedestrians is highlighted in the literature. Studies by Purciel et al. and Ewing et al. have shown that aspects of the streetscape, such as the amount of street furniture, the percentage of windows on the street, and the percentage of active street frontage, are positively associated with pedestrian traffic. In our model, the definition of a "pedestrian generator" was developed based on destination accessibility and streetscape planning. Previous research on the relationship between the built environment and travel intention has identified "pedestrian generators" as places at each junction with high pedestrian foot traffic, such as eateries, museums, and parks.

## 2.2. Pedestrian demand modeling and random forest

Numerous models have been utilized to simulate and analyze pedestrian flow and crowd dynamics. For instance, Sathish and Venkatesh employed a random forest approach to investigate the relationship between pedestrian, driver, and environmental characteristics, with the aim of identifying factors that significantly influence the severity of pedestrian injuries caused by pedestrians. Similarly, Yang et al. utilized machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), ensemble decision trees (EDT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), to explore the relationship between pedestrian survival and traffic accident scenarios. Sababa also employed a random forest model to examine the relationship between pedestrian traffic accidents and the community environment. However, these research models are uninterpretable black box models. It is important to note that interpretable machine learning models are essential as data scientists need to prevent model bias and help decision makers understand how to use these models correctly. Furthermore, the severity of the scenarios necessitates that the models provide evidence of how they work and avoid mistakes. Moreover, most of the current research focuses on the relationship between traffic accidents and people, and no one has used the random forest model to explain the relationship between people's travel intention and the community environment. Therefore, this study applied an interpretable random forest regression model based on SHAP to investigate the characteristics of streets that attract people to walk. SHAP is a "model interpretation" package developed in Python that can interpret the output of any machine learning model. Its name comes from SHapley Additive exPlanation. Inspired by cooperative game theory, SHAP builds an additive explanation model, with all features being regarded as "contributors". For each predicted sample, the model produces a predicted value, and the SHAP value is the value assigned to each feature in that sample.

# 3. Case studies and Data Collection

## 3.1. Study area

Eight high-traffic streets in Buffalo were selected for the fieldwork for this study.<br/> <br/>

#### Figure 1
<br/> <br/>
Figure 1 depicts the study area, which comprises eight streets that were selected as the study's locations due to their status as main thoroughfares in the city of Buffalo. These boulevards, which are primarily business-oriented, pass through significant areas such as the Lower West Side, Downtown, West Side, and North Buffalo. According to the American Planning Association's 2007 Great Places in America Program, the Elmwood Village on the West Side was ranked as the third-best neighborhood, owing to the presence of a diverse range of restaurants, art galleries, museums, shops, caf√©s, and other establishments that serve as "catalysts" for foot circulation to and from local businesses, thus accelerating neighborhood development. The area surrounding the avenue is one of the few vibrant sectors that fuel Buffalo's economy, and the public has access to a variety of parks, schools, and public areas where they can congregate, walk, and play. These avenues cut across the western section of Delaware Park as part of the Olmsted Park and Parkway network, providing numerous areas for relaxation and scenic beauty, which attract both locals and visitors.

## 3.2. Data Collection

The study employed the Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transit Commission's (GBNRTC) Transportation Data Management System to collect data on traffic flow, pedestrian movement, geographic information at street crossings, and intersection count dates and times for each location along the avenue. The study also collected geographic data on "pedestrian generators," which included restaurants, supermarkets, markets, art galleries, event venues, office and retail complexes, and trees, among others. Other data collected included population makeup, crime statistics by type, traffic accidents, and land use portfolios with reference to Buffalo tax parcels. Shapefiles were used to geocode tabular information on the locations of pedestrian generators. Pedestrian counts were taken at each intersection of the road every 15 minutes, eight hours a day. The designated time slots for the counts were 7am to 10am, 12pm to 2pm, and 3pm to 6pm. Although the data was collected from May to August from 2009 to 2020, few datasets contained information from January, the coldest month in Buffalo. The study utilized pedestrian counts to assess the vibrancy of the streets.

```

## 3.3. Data Processing

In order to determine the number of adjacent pedestrian generators, the study established the radius of each intersection. Studies conducted in the United States frequently use 0.25 miles as the acceptable walking distance. However, walking distance and time can vary depending on the objective and demographic. To calculate pedestrian generators, this study selected a fair walking distance of 0.25 miles from each intersection. The study counted pedestrian generators within a network radius buffer of 0.25 miles that was created using network analyst at each intersection along the eight chosen roadways, as illustrated in Figure 2. <br/><br/>Population, crime, and traffic accidents are often used as objective measurements to evaluate the walkability of neighborhoods as one of the three-dimensional factors (density, variety, design). The study obtained information on the population composition in the area surrounding each junction from Social Explorer, ACS 2015 (5-year estimates), at the census block group level. Crime data, 311 service requests, and traffic accident data were obtained from the Buffalo Open Data period of 2009 to 2020. For detailed data information, please refer to Table 1.

This study also employs the SHAP machine learning model to provide explanations for the model's predictions. The creation and validation of the model are conducted using Python, as it offers a more suitable API for operating the SHAP explanation model. The obtained results are presented in Figure 3.

# 5. Discussion and Conclusion
Upon conducting tests, our model demonstrated an accuracy rate of over 75% in accurately predicting the test data. This research provides evidence supporting the notion that the street environment has an impact on the number of pedestrians on the street, with business activities, crime rate, and traffic quality having the greatest impact. Based on variable importance, the top 10 variables most highly correlated with the number of pedestrians on the street include the number of commercial areas, the number of motor vehicles on the street, the crime rate of assault, the number of traffic accidents, the rate of robbery crime, the quality of traffic, the total number of population, nonviolent crime, and vehicle theft. Subsequently, we utilized SHAP to further elucidate the relationship between the variables in the model and the number of pedestrians. Our findings reveal that when there is a high density of pedestrians on the street, commercial activities, resident population, traffic problems, the number of bus stops, and the robbery crime rate are typically more prevalent. This is consistent with previous research indicating that commercial activities are more likely to attract individuals to drive and walk nearby, and that when a large number of individuals gather in specific locations, it often leads to severe traffic problems. Furthermore, studies on crime have demonstrated that robberies are more likely to occur in areas where pedestrians congregate, as increased pedestrian traffic provides more targets for criminal activity and dense crowds can interfere with law enforcement efforts to apprehend perpetrators. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the spatial patterns of pedestrian activity and the changing relationship between the built environment and pedestrian traffic. We hope that this research will provide guidance to policymakers and urban planners, enabling them to transform the built environment to promote street dynamism and improve community quality of life.
